Welcome to my website!
I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [Department of Economics at the University of Utah](https://www.econ.utah.edu/).

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, industrial organization, and environmental economics. I am also interested in behavioral economics, particularly its applications in health and cognitive science.
