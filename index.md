Welcome to my website!
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics at the University of Utah](https://www.econ.utah.edu/).

My research focuses on applied microeconomics, industrial organization, and environmental economics. I also work in behavioral economics, with a particular emphasis on its applications to health behavior and cognitive processes. I have experience teaching Microeconomics, Public Policy, Econometrics and Statistics at the graduate and undergraduate level.

In my recent research, I explore how targeted policy interventions and market institutions shape pricing, adoption, and firm behavior in emerging clean-technology markets, with a focus on the electric vehicle (EV) sector.
